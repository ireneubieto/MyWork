# Gouraud and Phong Illumination

## Main Concept

Starting from a previous version of this project, which was a **Ray Tracer** that could render different materials as Phong, Diffuse, Glossy, Mirror and Glass (these last two using specular reflections and transmission); different shapes as spheres, infinite planes, and triangles (by ray intersection concepts) and also took into account the lightning conditions of the scene and was able to apply both direct illumination and global illumination.

From there, we implemented a few improvements as we wanted to focus on meshes and deepen into how they are loaded and how they work:
