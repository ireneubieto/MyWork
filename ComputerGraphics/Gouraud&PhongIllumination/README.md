# Gouraud and Phong Illumination

## Main Concept

In this project we learned how to work with the GPU to implement shaders. We applied Gouraud by creating a shader that computed vertex illumination and Phong by creating another shader that computed pixel illumination. We also applied blending so we were able to use multiple lights, and camera movement to enable interaction.

Then, we improved the Phong shader (that used information per pixel) to apply textures.

### Controls and functionalities

Keys W, A, S and D: move the camera (eye vector)
Keys UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT: move the light (light 1)

Change materials:
Key 1: Plastic
Key 2: Gold
Key 3: Argent
Key 4: Rubber
Key 5: Texture

Change shading:
P: Phong (default)
G: Gouraud

Change light color:
Key 7: Red
Key 8: Green
Key 9: Blue

Change light components:
Keys Z + UP: Increase ambient
Keys Z + Down: Decrease ambient
Keys X + UP: Increase diffuse
Keys X + Down: Decrease diffuse
Keys C + UP: Increase specular
Keys C + Down: Decrease specular

Two lights:
Key H: Turn light 2 on
Key O: Turn light 2 off
Keys UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT + L: Move light 2

Key 0: Reset
