## Introduction

My name is Irene Ubieto Alamillo, I'm 22 years old at the moment of writing this and I live in Barcelona.

<a name="eng"></a>
## Engineering

I am currently finishing a Bachelor's Degree in Audiovisual Systems Engineering at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, and I did a six month Erasmus Program at Aalborg Universitet in Copenhagen, Denmark.

In this section are some of the projects I've made related to my career.

### Academic background

<a name="cg"></a>
#### Computer Graphics

During my Bachelor's degree I have learned about computer graphics in several courses, theoretically from the bases, mathematically and practically. The programming language was C++ for all of them and you can find them at my [Computer Graphics Section](https://github.com/ireneubieto/MyWork/blob/main/ComputerGraphics).

<a name="gd"></a>
#### Game Development

I have learned about game development both practically and theoretically in various courses at UPF and AAU.

The ones at UPF made me take a step further in my C and C++ programming skills, mathematical thinking, and problem-solving. The projects are [Island Escape](https://github.com/ireneubieto/MyWork/blob/main/Videogames/IslandEscape) and [Cook & Jump](https://github.com/ireneubieto/MyWork/blob/main/Videogames/CookAndJump).<br />
The ones at AAU taught me about game theory and design and that is where I learned to use Unity engine and work on my C# skills. The projects are [Blank](https://github.com/ireneubieto/MyWork/blob/main/Videogames/Blank) and a study about [How to engage university students in reading H.C. Andersen’s fairy tale ”The Little Mermaid” through a serious game](https://github.com/ireneubieto/MyWork/blob/main/Videogames/TheLittleMermaid).

<a name="wd"></a>
#### Web Development

During my Erasmus program at Aalborg Universitet I took a Technologies for Web and Social Media course, where I developed the [LlucSemisWildlifePhotography](https://github.com/ireneubieto/MyWork/blob/main/WebDevelopment/LlucSemisPhotography) website.

<a name="pro"></a>
### Personal and professional background

I have also been working and developing in some fields outside my class projects. 

<a name="wd2"></a>
#### Web Development

Web development is one of the fields I have worked on the most by myself.

There are two main projects that helped me enhance my web development skills. <br />
The first one is a project of a hackathon challenged, called [ecoAction](https://github.com/ireneubieto/MyWork/blob/main/WebDevelopment/ecoAction). It was the first website I have ever programmed. <br />
The second project is a startup website that's working at the moment, [reboom.es](https://github.com/ireneubieto/MyWork/blob/main/WebDevelopment/Reboom.es).
