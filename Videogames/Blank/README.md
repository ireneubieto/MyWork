## Main Concept

”Escape the forest and solve the mystery of your life”.

The main idea for this game was to make the player escape from certain scenes by collecting memories and skills, which would help the player remember its own story. One possible outcome of the story was to make the player ”remember” that they were supposed to rescue someone. With this definition, the game would fit in the category of rescue and escape, and also exploration, as they need to explore the scenes to find the memories and skills, as they need to solve the mystery of their own story to pass levels and the game.

## Game Engine

This game was developed using Unity Engine and C# for the AAU course Theory and Practice of Game Design and Development.
