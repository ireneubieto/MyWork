# Cook & Jump

## Main Concept

Mixed Reality arcade videogame created for the TrampoLima project, proposing a game for which the Interactive Trampoline movements where necessary. It consists on a cooking game, where the goal is to earn money by doing burgers in the correct way. Everytime the user does a burger in a wrong way they lose lives. There are levels and different categories of difficulty, for which the conveyor belt goes faster. Every action and ingredient has a different movement, like doing a kick jump for tossing dirty dishes, or jump on top of a burger when it is done.
