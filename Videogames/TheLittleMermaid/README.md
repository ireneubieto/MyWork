# How to engage university students in reading H.C. Andersen’s fairy tale ”The Little Mermaid” through a serious game

## Main Concept

This project uses H.C. Andersen’s fairy “The Little Mermaid” in a serious game to engage university students to read more. This project builds on previous work for both serious games and engagement, specifically reading engagement in an interactive media narrative and storytelling. The game itself is done in Unity 3D, has three main levels and multiple transitions levels. A progression system is implemented to make sure the participants are not missing out on any important story element. This project consists of 25 participants within the age range of 18-24, 20 being male and 5 being female. The participants were recruited online through social media. The test itself consists of a questionnaire, a web-based game and a semi-structured interview. The questionnaire consists of four parts (“Introduction”, “Mid-game 1”, “Mid-game 2” and “After the game”). The results for this project show an increase in engagement within the game by introducing new information but decreases when they finish the game. However, the implications of these results do suggest that more work needs to be done and more areas can be explored.

## Game Engine

This game was developed using Unity Engine and C# for the AAU final bachelor project.
