# Reboom.es

## Main Concept

reboom.es is a website that recommends smartphones or laptops to users using a simple test. As it is a startup and an ongoing project the files are private, but you can see the results and enjoy it on the [website](https://www.reboom.es) itself.

It does not only have the test functionality but there's also a "sale" page exposing those smartphones or laptops that are on sale at the moment. You can also log in on the website to save your test results or your favorite devices.
