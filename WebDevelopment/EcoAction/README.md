# ecoAction

## Main Concept

ecoAction is a project aiming to be a social website to enhance ecological activities by creating a community that can share eco-friendly experiences.
This was to be done by programming easy to attend events, giving points and rewards for ecological actions, and also offer ecological tips and reviews
eco-friendly establishments in Barcelona.

This project was created for the "take care of the environment" challenge of the hackathon Mamuthack 2019, and it won the prize for the "best market
outlet" category.

This version is a reduced version that shows the main idea of the project, but the final result was a deeper website that made use of a database with
php and sql. There was also a twitter bot implemented to throw the daily challenges on twitter and give points to the users that achieved them.
